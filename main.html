                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <li>To make the dough: Weigh your Flour or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix and knead together all of the dough ingredients by hand, mixer or bread machine till you've created a soft & smooth dough.</li>
                    <li>Covered the dough for 1 hour & allow the dough to rise. After dough has risen use immediately or refrigerate for up to 24 hours (This will heighten the crust's flavor).</li>
                    <li>Divide your refrigerated or immediately raised dough in to half.</li>
                    <li>Use baking paper or lightly grease two 12" to 14" round pizza pans or baking pans (if you don't have pizza pans).</li>
                    <li>Shape each piece of dough into 10" to 14" disk (your choice: thick crust or thin crust) and place in the prepared pans.</li>
                    <li>Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours till the crust is as puffy as you like. While the crust is rising, prepare the filling and towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 220Â°C.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease a frying pan saute the ham.</li>
                    <li>To prepare the pizza: Bake the pizza crusts, without toppings for about 12 minutes till they're set but not browned.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and spread with pizza sauce. Layer with the pineapple and ham, then sprinkle cheese (your choice of cheese).</li>
                    <li>Return pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 12 to 16 minutes, till the crust is brown and the cheese is melted and barely beginning to brown.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and transfer to a pizza plate or your choice of plate and slice into about 8 pieces per pizza.</li>
