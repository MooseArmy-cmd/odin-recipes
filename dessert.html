                <h3>Instructions</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Whip together egg yolks and 50g sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Whip cream and remaining 50g sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and continue to whip until it creates a soft spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone cheese mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
                    <li>Combine espresso and rum ina shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
                    <li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture (they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid to long. Place dipped ladyfingers rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish (if needed breaking fingers in half to fill bottom). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture. </li>
                    <li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder.</li>
                    <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before slicing or scooping to serve.</li>
                </ol>
